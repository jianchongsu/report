Social networking servers have applied to the lots of the Websites,such as Gowalla,Quora.In this website,users are becoming the friendship network,almostly different users have their own friends.There are also user A and user B have the same friend user C.Simply,more same friends between A and B mean quite a lot similar.However,if both user A and user B have the same  numbers of the friends with user C,the amount friends of A and B need to take into consideration.

Here, we propose the __Jaccard Similarity Coefficient(JSC)__ to measue each two users' similarity in the social network.We use the  notation __V(A)__ express the all ids of the A's friends
                
$JSC(A,B)=\frac{|V(A) \cap V(B)|}{|V(A) \cup V(B)|}$
